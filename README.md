# Development
Repo for team members to work on their own parts of the project in the same repo for collaboration.

- Each group member has their own folder where they will work in
- Changes will be commited and pushed to master to ensure every group member has the most recent code changes
- Group members should not make changes to other group member's folders
- If one member needs to work with another member's code they should make a copy into their own folder to work with
